In the article What is Normal America?, Jed Kolko of FiveThirtyEight points out that the average American town is no longer a small town of white people, as many may think, by finding the country's most average towns based on demographics and size. Inspired by this article, we set out to find nation-wide demographic trends that extended beyond racial breakdowns. We set out to answer questions such as:
What are the most and least averages places in the US, and how do these results change based on the specific variables that we consider?
Where are the largest homogeneous areas in the US?
Where are places most similar and dissimilar from their neighbors, and how can we visualize these dynamics?

This task led us to a big data challenge involved data from the 2000 U.S. Census.
